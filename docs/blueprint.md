## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong pink (#E55A9B) for important buttons and accents to highlight key interactive elements and call-to-actions.
- Background: Light beige (#F5F5DC) as a calm backdrop, visually soft and in harmony with the baked goods theme.
- Accent color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA) to provide subtle visual contrast against the pink and beige elements.
- Headline Font: 'Belleza', sans-serif, for titles, lending an elegant and fashionable touch.
- Body Font: 'Alegreya', serif, for main text, providing a readable and contemporary feel.
- Use simple, elegant icons that complement the soft color palette, representing navigation and functionality. Iconography will lean toward line art.
- Header will be sticky, with backdrop-blur; components from ShadCN UI will establish consistent structure and appearance. A basic footer provides essential legal navigation.
